  abstract = {This paper provides new insights into the electricity tracing methodology, by representing the inverted tracing upstream and downstream distribution matrices in the form of matrix power series and by applying linear algebra analysis. The th matrix power represents the contribution of each node to power flows in the other nodes through paths of length exactly in the digraph of flows. Such a representation proves the link between graph-based and linear equation-based approaches for electricity tracing. It also makes it possible to explain an earlier observation that circulating flows, which result in a cyclic directed graph of flows, can be detected by appearance of elements greater than one on the leading diagonal of the inverted tracing distribution matrices. Most importantly, for the first time a rigorous mathematical proof of the invertibility of the tracing distribution matrices is given, along with a proof of convergence for the matrix power series used in the paper; these proofs also allow an analysis of the conditioning of the tracing distribution matrices. Theoretical results are illustrated throughout using simple network examples.},

A new method of tracing the flow of electricity in meshed electrical networks is proposed which may be applied to both real and reactive power flows. The method allows assessment of how much of the real and reactive power output from a particular station goes to a particular load. It also allows the assessment of contributions of individual generators (or load:;) to individual line flows. A loss-apportioning algorithm has also been introduced which allows the break down of the total transmission loss into components to be allocated to individual loads or generators. The method can be useful in providing additional insight into power system operation and can be used to modify existing tariffs of charging for transmission loss, reactive power and transmission services.},

  year = {2020},
  month = feb,
  abstract = {Although recent studies have shown that electricity systems with shares of wind and solar above 80\% can be affordable, economists have raised concerns about market integration. Correlated generation from variable renewable sources depresses market prices, which can cause wind and solar to cannibalize their own revenues and prevent them from covering their costs from the market. This cannibalization appears to set limits on the integration of wind and solar, and thus contradict studies that show that high shares are cost effective. Here we show from theory and with numerical examples how policies interact with prices, revenue and costs for renewable electricity systems. The decline in average revenue seen in some recent literature is due to an implicit policy assumption that technologies are forced into the system, whether it be with subsidies or quotas. If instead the driving policy is a carbon dioxide cap or tax, wind and solar shares can rise without cannibalising their own market revenue, even at penetrations of wind and solar above 80\%. Policy is thus the primary factor driving lower market values; the variability of wind and solar is only a secondary factor that accelerates the decline if they are subsidised. The strong dependence of market value on the policy regime means that market value needs to be used with caution as a measure of market integration.},

  abstract = {Measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are often considered separately, in terms of electricity, heating, transport, and industry. This can lead to the measures being prioritised in the wrong sectors, and neglects interactions between the sectors. In addition, studies often focus on specific greenhouse gas reduction targets, despite the uncertainty regarding what targets are desirable and when. In this paper, these issues are examined for the period after 2030 in an existing openly-available, hourly-resolved, per-country, and highly-renewable model of the European energy system, PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, that includes electricity, land transport, and space and water heating. A parameter sweep of different reduction targets for direct carbon dioxide emissions is performed, ranging from no target down to zero direct emissions. The composition of system investments, the interactions between the energy sectors, shadow prices, and the market values of the system components are analysed as the carbon dioxide limit changes. Electricity and land transport are defossilised first, while the reduction of emissions in space and water heating is delayed by the expense of new components and the difficulty of supplying heat during cold spells with low wind and solar power generation. For deep carbon dioxide reduction, power-to-gas changes the system dynamics by reducing curtailment and increasing the market values of wind and solar power. Using this model setup, cost projections for 2030, and optimal cross-border transmission, the costs of a zero-direct-emission system in these sectors are marginally cheaper than today's system, even before the health and environmental benefits are taken into account.},

  abstract = {Understanding electricity consumption and production patterns is a necessary first step toward reducing the health and climate impacts of associated emissions. In this work, the economic input\textendash output model is adapted to track emissions flows through electric grids and quantify the pollution embodied in electricity production, exchanges, and, ultimately, consumption for the 66 continental US Balancing Authorities (BAs). The hourly and BA-level dataset we generate and release leverages multiple publicly available datasets for the year 2016. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of considering location and temporal effects as well as electricity exchanges in estimating emissions footprints. While increasing electricity exchanges makes the integration of renewable electricity easier, importing electricity may also run counter to climate-change goals, and citizens in regions exporting electricity from high-emission-generating sources bear a disproportionate air-pollution burden. For example, 40\% of the carbon emissions related to electricity consumption in California's main BA were produced in a different region. From 30 to 50\% of the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides released in some of the coal-heavy Rocky Mountain regions were related to electricity produced that was then exported. Whether for policymakers designing energy efficiency and renewable programs, regulators enforcing emissions standards, or large electricity consumers greening their supply, greater resolution is needed for electric-sector emissions indices to evaluate progress against current and future goals.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of transmission cost allocation (TCA) in very large networks with multiple interconnected regions or countries. The basis of one scheme recently put forward is a single-area TCA algorithm from which inter-regional compensations are computed. One concern about this approach is that an international operator (IO) must have access to detailed information that autonomous regions or countries may not be willing or able to share. This led to the development of a new multiarea TCA scheme, called multiarea decoupled (MAD), in which each region carries out its own TCA, while the IO carries out a region-wise TCA on the network of tie lines. In MAD, the IO does not require detailed and possibly proprietary information about regional networks, relying only on the characteristics of the tie-line network and the extent to which each region uses such a network. This is a key issue, especially in North America, considering FERC's intention to provide Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) with exclusive autonomy to provide transmission service and to set and administer their own transmission-use tariffs. Numerical studies on the proposed scheme are described, including a four-area system based on the IEEE reliability test system (RTS) network.},

  abstract = {In an open-access environment, transmission constraints can result in different energy prices throughout the network. These prices are, in fact, dependent on a number of factors such as the generating unit bid, system load level, network topology and security limits imposed on the transmission network due to thermal, and voltage and stability considerations. Computing these energy prices at all buses in large transmission networks under given system operating conditions can be time-cosuming. This paper describes a simple methodology based on the analysis performed by the Hydro One in-house computer program (PROCOSE) to calculate, for a given period of time, transmission congestion cost (TCC) in dollars per unit time and locational marginal pricing (LMP) in dollars per megawatt-hour (MWh) at any selected bus in the transmission system. In addition, the information provided by the program output on congested transmission elements is used to identify buses in the network whose LMPs are representative of the entire network. The computed LMPs at these buses are used to define zones in the network where each zone has its LMP. The proposed methodology can be used to carry out sensitivity studies to determine the impact of changes in system parameters and operating conditions on the LMPs. The proposed method is illustrated using the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) and the Hydro One network system.},

  abstract = {In power systems, flow allocation (FA) methods allow to allocate usage and costs of the transmission grid to each single market participant. Based on predefined assumptions, the power flow is split into isolated generator specific or producer specific sub-flows. Two prominent FA methods, Marginal Participation (MP) and Equivalent Bilateral Exchanges (EBE), build upon the linearized power flow and thus on the Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDF). Despite their intuitive and computationally efficient concept, they are restricted to networks with passive transmission elements only. As soon as a significant number of controllable transmission elements, such as High-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines, operate in the system, they loose their applicability. This work reformulates the two methods in terms of Virtual Injection Patters (VIP) which allows to efficiently introduce a shift parameter q, tuning contributions of net sources and net sinks in the network. Major properties and differences of the methods are pointed out. Finally, it is shown how the MA and EBE algorithm can be applied to generic meshed AC-DC electricity grids: Introducing a pseudo-impedance {$\omega$}\textasciimacron{} which reflects the operational state of controllable elements, allows to extend the PTDF matrix under the assumption of knowing the current system's flow. Basic properties from graph theory are used for solving the pseudo-impedance dependent on the position in the network. This directly enables e.g. HVDC lines to be considered in the MP and EBE algorithm. The extended methods are applied to a low-carbon European network model (PyPSA-EUR) with a spatial resolution of N=181 and an 18\% transmission expansion. The allocations of VIP and MP, show that countries with high wind potentials profit most from the transmission grid expansion. Based on the average usage of transmission system expansion a method of distributing operational and capital expenditures is proposed. Further it is shown, how injections from renewable resources strongly drive country-to-country allocations and thus cross-border electricity flows.},

Added a function {$<$}code{$>\_$}helpers.load\_network(){$<$}/code{$>$} which loads a network with overridden components specified in {$<$}code{$>$}snakemake.config['override\_components']{$<$}/code{$>$} (\#128). Bugfix in {$<$}code{$>$}base\_network{$<$}/code{$>$} which now finds all closest links, not only the first entry (\#143). Bugfix in {$<$}code{$>$}cluster\_network{$<$}/code{$>$} which now skips recalculation of link parameters if there are no links (\#149). Added information on pull requests to contribution guidelines (\#151). Improved documentation on open-source solver setup and added usage warnings. Updated {$<$}code{$>$}conda{$<$}/code{$>$} environment regarding {$<$}code{$>$}pypsa{$<$}/code{$>$}, {$<$}code{$>$}pyproj{$<$}/code{$>$}, {$<$}code{$>$}gurobi{$<$}/code{$>$}, {$<$}code{$>$}lxml{$<$}/code{$>$}. This release requires PyPSA v0.17.0.},

  abstract = {The application of the flow tracing method to power flows in and out of storage units allows to analyse the usage of this technology option in large-scale interconnected electricity systems. We apply this method to a data-driven model of the European electricity network, which uses a techno-economic optimisation to determine generation and storage capacities and dispatch, assuming a 95\% reduction of CO2 emission compared to 1990 levels. A flow-based analysis of the power inflow into the different storage technologies confirms the intuition that longerterm hydrogen storage is mainly utilised for wind, whereas shortterm battery storage mostly receives inflow from solar power generation. The usage of storage technologies in general shows a local-but-global behaviour: Whereas on average the power outflow from these capacities is predominantly consumed locally inside the same node, when exported it is also transmitted over long distances as a global flexibility option for the entire system.},
